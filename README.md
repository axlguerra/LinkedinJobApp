# LinkedinJobApp

Automatic LinkedIn Job Application with Python!

We all know how tedious it is to apply for jobs in LinkedIn, filling the same forms repeatedly and just hope that your application will stand out from the rest.
This Python project can help you do this for you. (With some restrictions of course). Working with Selenium, a library used for automating web applications, I wrote a code for a bot that search for an specific job position, then loops through all the applications.
-I’ll be applying with the “Easy Apply” feature to avoid complex questionnaires. (Ill be working on a script to read the questions and answer back later)
And to avoid getting banned from LinkedIn and companies that I would love to apply later I created a fake account to send fake applications, I had to run this over 200 times to FINALLY getting it to work.
In this video I’m only applying to 1 job position (Don’t blink because it goes really fast), but you can make this work for EVERY application there is in your search.
